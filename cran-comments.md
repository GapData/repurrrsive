This is a resubmission.

> Thanks, please write package names and software names in single quotes (e.g. 'Gapminder','JSON',...).

I have added single quotes around 'JSON', 'XML', 'GitHub', and 'gapminder'.

Below are the original submission notes.

## Test environments

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
